            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS <hi>Humbly offered by the</hi> Six-Clerks <hi>of the</hi> Court <hi>of</hi> Chancery, <hi>to Repeal or Explain the Latter Part of a Clause, in an</hi> Act <hi>of the last Sessions of</hi> Parliament, <hi>made for the Amendment of the</hi> Law, <hi>and the better Advancement of</hi> Justice.</head>
            <p>
               <label>The Former Part of the Clause is this;</label>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">THAT no Copy, Abstract, or Tenor of any Bill in Equity, do go with the Dedimus or Commission for taking the Defendant's Answer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Latter Part is this;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">But in Lieu and Recompence thereof, the Sworn-Clerks of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> shall take to their own Use, in all Causes, the whole Termly Fee of 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> and also the whole Fee or Fees of all small Writs, made by the Sworn-Clerks.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Fee for the Tenor of the Bill, did belong to the Six-Clerks, as appeared by Presentment 40 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which, <hi>Anno</hi> 1635, among other Increase of Allowance, they gave to their Under-Clerks, <hi>in Consideration of their Faithful Dealing with the Suitors, and the Records of the Court.</hi> But the Under-Clerks instead of their Fair Dealing with the Suitors, have by grosly abusing That which was of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Use in its first Institution, <hi>most deservedly lost the Advantage of that Fee.</hi> And therefore, no Reason they should have a Recompence.</p>
            <p>But suppose, (what cannot be Proved) that it is Reasonable, That the Under-Clerks should have a Recompence, <hi>why should the Equivalent be taken out of the Six-Clerks Pocket?</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>The Six-Clerks never did Insure the Tenor to the Under-Clerks:</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Nor did they ever Insure against the Under-Clerks Forfeiture, or Abuse of it:</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>Neither have they contributed any thing to the taking of it away:</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>The Six-Clerks have an undoubted Right, and Freehold in their Offices and Fees belonging to it for their Lives:</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. <hi>The Under-Clerks might as justly have pitch'd upon the Office, Possession or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of any other Subject, to have made up their Recompence as the Six-Clerks.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The Six-Clerks most Humbly Represent, That they are ready to make Oath, that none of them since their Admission into their Offices, have made 700 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> one Year with another. And that their Expences in executing their Offices, is near 200 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> each.</p>
            <p>The Under-Clerks have made it out more fully than any Thing they attempted, That the Latter Part of the Recompencing Clause, takes from each Six-Clerk 400 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> so that the Six-Clerks are stript of their Livelyhood, without any Fault assigned against them.</p>
            <p>The Six-Clerks further Humbly insist, That from the Time of their Admission into their Offices, they are Intituled to all Fees, Perquisites, Profits, and other le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Rights their Predecessors formerly enjoyed, (and that under a far stronger Title, than their Under-Clerks can pretend to have by the Ordinance of 1668) which they have no ways Forfeited.</p>
            <p>Their Application to the Business and Duty of their Places, have intirely divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Intentions from any other Means of Livelyhood, They have most of them Families, who Depend upon them as their only Support. Marriages have been En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd upon the visible Credit and Income of these Places; and it is very Evident, if this Clause stands, That the Six Clerks and their Families, without the Aid and Assistance of this <hi>Honourable House,</hi> must unavoidably Suffer, and be reduced to Poverty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore it is most Humbly Submitted,</hi> Whether the Clause is not fit to be Repealed or Explain'd? Or whether the Six-Clerks shall not be repair'd some other Way?</p>
